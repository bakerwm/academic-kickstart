Abstract: Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mediates class switching by binding to a small fraction of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to diversify the antibody repertoire. The precise mechanism for highly selective AID targeting in the genome has remained elusive. Here, we report an RNA-binding protein, ROD1 (also known as PTBP3), that is both required and sufficient to define AID-binding sites genome-wide in activated B cells. ROD1 interacts with AID via an ultraconserved loop, which proves to be critical for the recruitment of AID to ssDNA using bi-directionally transcribed nascent RNAs as stepping stones. Strikingly, AID-specific mutations identified in human patients with hyper-IgM syndrome type 2 (HIGM2) completely disrupt the AID interacting surface with ROD1, thereby abolishing the recruitment of AID to immunoglobulin (Ig) loci. Together, our results suggest that bi-directionally transcribed RNA traps the RNA-binding protein ROD1, which serves as a guiding system for AID to load onto specific genomic loci to induce DNA rearrangement during immune responses.

Abstract: Protein-RNA interaction networks are essential to understand gene regulation control. Identifying binding sites of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) by the UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) represents one of the most powerful methods to map protein-RNA interactions in vivo. However, the traditional CLIP protocol is technically challenging, which requires radioactive labeling and suffers from material loss during PAGE-membrane transfer procedures. Here we introduce a super-efficient CLIP method (GoldCLIP) that omits all gel purification steps. This nonisotopic method allows us to perform highly reproducible CLIP experiments with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), a classical RBP in human cell lines. In principle, our method guarantees sequencing library constructions, providing the protein of interest can be successfully crosslinked to RNAs in living cells. GoldCLIP is readily applicable to diverse proteins to uncover their endogenous RNA targets.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs. We examined the subcellular distribution of three miRNAs in exponentially growing HeLa cells and found that the vast majority are associated with mRNAs in polysomes. Several lines of evidence indicate that most of these mRNAs, including a known miRNA-regulated target (KRAS mRNA), are actively being translated.

Abstract: A large fraction of our genome consists of mobile genetic elements. Governing transposons in germ cells is critically important, and failure to do so compromises genome integrity, leading to sterility. In animals, the piRNA pathway is the key to transposon constraint, yet the precise molecular details of how piRNAs are formed and how the pathway represses mobile elements remain poorly understood. In an effort to identify general requirements for transposon control and components of the piRNA pathway, we carried out a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila ovarian somatic sheet cells. We identified and validated 87 genes necessary for transposon silencing. Among these were several piRNA biogenesis factors. We also found CG3893 (asterix) to be essential for transposon silencing, most likely by contributing to the effector step of transcriptional repression. Asterix loss leads to decreases in H3K9me3 marks on certain transposons but has no effect on piRNA levels.

Abstract: Piwi proteins and their associated small RNAs are essential for fertility in animals. In part, this is due to their roles in guarding germ cell genomes against the activity of mobile genetic elements. piRNA populations direct Piwi proteins to silence transposon targets and, as such, form a molecular code that discriminates transposons from endogenous genes. Information ultimately carried by piRNAs is encoded within genomic loci, termed piRNA clusters. These give rise to long, single-stranded, primary transcripts that are processed into piRNAs. Despite the biological importance of this pathway, neither the characteristics that define a locus as a source of piRNAs nor the mechanisms that catalyze primary piRNA biogenesis are well understood. We searched an EMS-mutant collection annotated for fertility phenotypes for genes involved in the piRNA pathway. Twenty-seven homozygous sterile strains showed transposon-silencing defects. One of these, which strongly impacted primary piRNA biogenesis, harbored a causal mutation in CG5508, a member of the Drosophila glycerol-3-phosphate O-acetyltransferase (GPAT) family. These enzymes catalyze the first acylation step on the path to the production of phosphatidic acid (PA). Though this pointed strongly to a function for phospholipid signaling in the piRNA pathway, a mutant form of CG5508, which lacks the GPAT active site, still functions in piRNA biogenesis. We have named this new biogenesis factor Minotaur.

Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network maintains proper function of all organisms. Simple high-throughput technologies are desperately needed to delineate the landscape of PPI networks. While recent state-of-the-art yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) systems improved screening efficiency, either individual colony isolation, library preparation arrays, gene barcoding or massive sequencing are still required. Here, we developed a recombination-based 'library vs library' Y2H system (RLL-Y2H), by which multi-library screening can be accomplished in a single pool without any individual treatment. This system is based on the phiC31 integrase-mediated integration between bait and prey plasmids. The integrated fragments were digested by MmeI and subjected to deep sequencing to decode the interaction matrix. We applied this system to decipher the trans-kingdom interactome between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and host cells and further identified Rv2427c interfering with the phagosome-lysosome fusion. This concept can also be applied to other systems to screen protein-RNA and protein-DNA interactions and delineate signaling landscape in cells.

Abstract: The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a small RNA-based innate immune system that defends germ cell genomes against transposons. In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here we show that the CG9754 protein is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 to nascent messenger RNA transcripts causes cotranscriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We have named CG9754 "Panoramix," and we propose that this protein could act as an adaptor, scaffolding interactions between the piRNA pathway and the general silencing machinery that it recruits to enforce transcriptional repression.

Abstract: Alternative splicing makes a major contribution to proteomic diversity in higher eukaryotes with approximately 70% of genes encoding two or more isoforms. In most cases, the molecular mechanisms responsible for splice site choice remain poorly understood. Here, we used a randomization-selection approach in vitro to identify sequence elements that could silence a proximal strong 5' splice site located downstream of a weakened 5' splice site. We recovered two exonic and four intronic motifs that effectively silenced the proximal 5' splice site both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, silencing was only observed in the presence of the competing upstream 5' splice site. Biochemical evidence strongly suggests that the silencing motifs function by altering the U1 snRNP/5' splice site complex in a manner that impairs commitment to specific splice site pairing. The data indicate that perturbations of non-rate-limiting step(s) in splicing can lead to dramatic shifts in splice site choice.

Abstract: The Tudor domain-containing (Tdrd) family proteins play a critical role in transposon silencing in animal gonads by recognizing the symmetrically dimethylated arginine (sDMA) on the (G/A)R motif of the N-terminal of PIWI family proteins via the eTud domains. Papi, also known as "Tdrd2," is involved in Zucchini-mediated PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) 3'-end maturation. Intriguingly, a recent study showed that, in papi mutant flies, only Piwi-bound piRNAs increased in length, and not Ago3-bound or Aub-bound piRNAs. However, the molecular and structural basis of the Papi-Piwi complex is still not fully understood, which limits mechanistic understanding of the function of Papi in piRNA biogenesis. In the present study, we determined the crystal structures of Papi-eTud in the apo form and in complex with a peptide containing unmethylated or dimethylated R10 residues. Structural and biochemical analysis showed that the Papi interaction region on the Drosophila Piwi contains an RGRRR motif (R7-R11) distinct from the consensus (G/A)R motif recognized by canonical eTud. Mass spectrometry results indicated that Piwi is the major binding partner of Papi in vivo. The papi mutant flies suffered from both fertility and transposon-silencing defects, supporting the important role conferred to Papi in piRNA 3' processing through direct interaction with Piwi proteins.
