Transposons comprise nearly half of the human genome. Transposon control is extremely challenging because the host must distinguish diverse elements from protein coding genes and selectively silence the former. Mutations in the piRNA pathway often result in dramatic transposon overexpression and consequently render the organism completely sterile.
